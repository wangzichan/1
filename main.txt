The First approached the Elephant, 
    And happening to fall 
Against his broad and sturdy side, 
    At once began to bawl: “God bless! but the Elephant 
Is very like a wall!” 

The Second, feeling of the tusk, 
    Cried, “Ho! what have we here 
So very round and smooth and sharp? 
    To me ’tis mighty clear 
This wonder of an Elephant 
    Is very like a spear !” 

=======
The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear, 
    Said: “E’en the blindest man 
Can tell what this resembles most; 
    Deny the fact who can, 
This marvel of an 
    Elephant Is very like a fan!”
